            The ancient city of Benin, located in present-day Nigeria, was the capital of the Kingdom of Benin, one of the most powerful pre-colonial African states. 
            It was established around the 10th century AD and reached its peak between the 13th and 19th centuries under the leadership of the Obas (kings). 
            The kingdom was renowned for its sophisticated political system, advanced craftsmanship, and impressive urban planning.
